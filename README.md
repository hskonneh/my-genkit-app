# 🚀 My Genkit App

Welcome to "My Genkit App"! This is a powerful backend application built with Google's Genkit, designed to interact with various Google Cloud services for resource management, security, and execution tasks. It provides a robust framework for creating AI-powered flows that can automate and manage your cloud infrastructure.

---

## ✨ Features

- **🤖 AI-Powered Flows**: Built on the Google Genkit framework to create, run, and monitor AI-driven workflows.
- **☁️ Google Cloud Integration**: Seamlessly interacts with a suite of Google Cloud APIs, including:
  - Cloud Resource Manager (`v1`, `v1beta1`)
  - Binary Authorization (`v1`)
  - Container Analysis (`v1alpha1`)
  - Identity-Aware Proxy (`v1beta1`)
  - Policy Troubleshooter (`v1`)
  - Remote Build Execution (`v2`)
- **🔐 Secure Authentication**: Uses `google-auth-library` for secure and easy authentication with Google Cloud services.
- **📝 Structured Logging**: Implements `winston` for robust, multi-transport logging (console and file).
- **⚙️ Flexible Configuration**: Utilizes `json5` for human-friendly configuration files.

## 🏁 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher. You can download it from nodejs.org.
- **npm** or **yarn**: Included with Node.js or installable separately.
- **Google Cloud SDK**: Required for authentication. Install it from here.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-genkit-app.git
cd my-genkit-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all the necessary npm packages.

```bash
npm install
```

or if you use yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Configure Authentication

This application uses Application Default Credentials (ADC) to authenticate with Google Cloud.

1.  **Log in to gcloud**:
    Run the following command and follow the instructions in your browser to log in to your Google account.

    ```bash
    gcloud auth login
    ```

2.  **Set up Application Default Credentials**:
    This command will create a credentials file on your local machine that the application can automatically use.

    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

3.  **Set your Project ID**:
    Ensure your gcloud SDK is configured with the correct project.

    ```bash
    gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    ```

### 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and add any necessary environment variables, such as the Google Cloud project ID and region.

```env
# .env

GCLOUD_PROJECT="your-gcp-project-id"
GCLOUD_REGION="us-central1"
```

---

## 🎮 Usage

Once the installation and configuration are complete, you can start the application.

### Running the Genkit UI

Genkit comes with a developer UI to inspect and run your flows.

```bash
genkit start
```

This will start the Genkit development server, and you can access the UI at `http://localhost:4000`.

### Running in Production

To run the application in a production environment, you can use:

```bash
npm run start
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

We use a standard testing setup for our Node.js applications. To run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will execute all test files located in the `src` directory ending with `.test.ts`. Make sure to write tests for any new features or bug fixes.

---

## 🪵 Logging

This project uses `winston` for logging. Logs are streamed to two different locations:

- **Console**: All logs with a level of `info` or higher are printed to the console in a simple, colorized format during development.
- **Files**:
  - `error.log`: Contains only logs with a level of `error`.
  - `combined.log`: Contains all logs with a level of `info` or higher.

This setup ensures that you have persistent logs for debugging while maintaining a clean console output.
